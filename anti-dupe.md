How can we ensure that each card is received once and only once?
 
Using Bob and Alice again, I proposed that each time Bob recieved a new package, the first thing he should check is the numbering of the package. 
In the class example, each message was marked with a fraction such 1/12, 2/12, and so on. If Bob checks those fractions before deciding to recieved that package,
he could ensure that he is receiving each card once and only once. If Bob recieve any duplicates, he can quickly reject without having to accept them.
